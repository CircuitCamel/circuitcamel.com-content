# Size does matter

At the start of the internet most sites were as basic as can be, some html and maybe a couple lines of css, but today we have just basic blogs where you would have to download at least 2 MB of content, I'm not saying there is anything wrong with that only I would love if websites could load faster.

I experienced this first hand when I was traveling a couple months back, where every site felt like it took ages to load.  

To be fair, it wasn’t really that long, but being used to near-instant loading made it feel like we’d gone backwards.  

We can even see that in video games nowadays, where the developers assume the player will have the latest and greatest CPU, GPU, and whatever have you.  

But in the end, according to the Steam hardware survey (as of August 2025), the most popular GPU is a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, and at the fourth spot a GTX 1650.  

Also, with how developers can just throw graphical problems onto realtime AI frame generation like DLSS and AFMF, instead of solving them directly.

So what do developers have to do? optimize optimize optimize oh, and **optimize**.

Buut, we have to remember not to prematurely optimize, for example there has been a long time discussion if we should use `i++` or `++i` in C++.

Sure ++i is *technically* faster in some circumstances, but really are you going to tell me the performance problems that are plaguing you stems for **this??**

In short, optimise not before maturity.
