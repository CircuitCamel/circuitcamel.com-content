# My obsession with minecraft

I've been playing minecraft for at least 13 years at this point, what first started my obsession was d7oomy999 with his minecraft survival let's play, and since that day I begged my brother to buy me minecraft and he did buy the pocket edition on my sister's ipad 1 and it was *amazing*.
Since that day I've been playing it too much for my own health for instance on the playstaion I played 1300 hours and I had the ps4 since 2019 and stopped playing in late 2023.
Not sure what makes me like it so much, maybe the sandbox factor of it? But I don't like other sandbox games, the creativity part of it? I'm not much of a creative person.
It probably is just the memories I have in that game with my friends or myself, and every time I hop on to play I want to relive that feeling and create memories all over again.
But deep inside I know, we all know I can't recreate the same feeling I had when I started playing minecraft or when I played it with my friends in COVID. Still, it's nice trying to chase that feeling. You never know maybe it'll come back.

What is minecraft to you?
